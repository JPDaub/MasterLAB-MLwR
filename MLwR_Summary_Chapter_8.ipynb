        "## Theoretical basics\n",
        "This part aims to provide the reader with an theoretical understanding of the underlying concepts of market basket analysis.\n",
        "### Understanding association rules\n",
        "The goal of market basket analyses is the generation of association rules which enumerate patterns within the relationship among (purchased) items. An itemset is a group of one or more items in a single transaction and is denoted as follows: \n",
        "> {bread, peanut butter, jelly}.\n",
        "\n",
        "Resulting from this, the denotation of association rules is\n",
        "\n",
        "> {peanut butter,jelly} → {bread}.\n",
        "\n",
        "The left-hand-side (LHS) is the condition that has to be met in order to trigger the rule and the right-hand-side (RHS) is the expected result of meeting that condition.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A common approach to assess association rules is dividing them up into three categories: actionable, trivial, and inexplicable. Actionable rules are clearly formulated and provide meaningful insight. Trivial rules are clear but are not worth consideration as they provide only negligible information. The last category, inexplicable rules, are characterized by unclear relationships between items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Association rules are unsupervised learners which means that there is no need for the algorithm to be trained as it only finds interesting patterns in the dataset. Furthermore, they are used for knowledge discovery in large datasets rather than predictions. The foremost downside of association rules is the absence of an objective way to measure performance rule learner. \n",
        "\n",
        "### The apriori algorithm\n",
        "The datasets used for market basket analyses are almost always large. The number of potential itemsets grows exponentially with the number of features. The apriori algorithm constitutes a solution for this dilemma as the algorithm utilizes a simple prior belief about the properties of frequent itemsets. The apriori property suggests that all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent: If either {motor oil} or {lipstick} or both are considered infrequent the itemset {motor oil, lipstick} is eliminated as well. This approach reduces the number of rules for which the algorithm searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm uses statistical measures, namely support, confidence and lift, of an itemset to define a minimum threshold and to locate association rules. The **support** of an itemset answers the question of how frequently an itemset or rule occur in the data. \n",
        "A rule’s **confidence** is the measurement of its predictive power/accuracy and is defined with the following formula: \n",
        "\n",
        "> confidence (X→Y)=(support(X,Y))/(support(X)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Important is that the confidence that X leads to Y is not the same as confidence that Y leads to X. Strong association rules have both high support and high confidence. \n",
        "The metric **lift** measures how much more likely one item or itemset is to be purchased relative to its typical rate of purchase, given that you know another item or itemset has been purchased. The according formula is:\n",
        "\n",
        "> lift(X→Y)=(confidence(X→Y))/(support (Y)).\n",
        "\n",
        "The procedure of the apriori algorithm is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   The algorithm identifies all itemsets that meet the minimum support threshold applying multiple iterations.\n",
        "2.   Then, the algorithm creates rules from these itemsets using those meeting the minimums confidence threshold."

Instead of using a conventional matrix where each row has the same set of features, a sparse matrix is used.

As not every customer buys all product types, some cells don't contain values. This characteristic makes sparse matrices memory efficient as only occupied cells are saved. "

The minimum `support` level, which displays the smallest number of transactions needed to find a pattern worth consideration, is 0.006 (two purchases per day and approximately 60 purchases per month). Using a suitable level of `confidence` is equally important. If the threshold is too high, only few and often obvious rules will be found. Setting the threshold too low will result in too many unreliable rules. Using a level of 0.25 means that only rules will be considered that are correct at least 25% of the time. The `minlen` parameter deletes all rules with fewer than 2 items eliminating uninteresting rules. "
